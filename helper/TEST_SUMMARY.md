# Test Suite Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive test suite for the Databricks authentication system in the `helper/` directory. The tests cover all the authentication scenarios you requested, including different OBO scopes, same-workspace vs cross-workspace operations, and various authentication method selections.

## What Was Created

### 1. Updated Test Files

#### `tests/test_auth.py` (42 tests)
Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- **OBO Scope Configuration**: Testing all predefined scope sets (basic, analytics, full)
- **Scope Validation**: Testing operation scope requirements and validation
- **Auth Method Selection**: Testing automatic OBO vs U2M selection logic
- **Cross-Workspace Detection**: Testing that cross-workspace operations always use U2M
- **Client Creation**: Testing OBO and U2M client creation with proper authentication
- **Client Caching**: Testing that clients are properly cached and reused
- **Error Handling**: Testing edge cases and error conditions
- **Factory Methods**: Testing client factory creation with different configurations

#### `tests/test_auth_scenarios.py` (20 tests)
Advanced scenario tests covering:
- **Different OBO Scope Combinations**: Testing various scope configurations
- **Operation-Specific Testing**: Testing each operation type (vector_search, sql, serving_endpoint, etc.)
- **Agent Type Configurations**: Testing basic, analytics, and full agent types
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Testing scope configuration from environment
- **Custom Scope Configurations**: Testing user-defined scope combinations
- **Edge Cases**: Testing complex scenarios and error conditions

### 2. Supporting Files

#### `run_tests.py`
A convenient test runner script that provides:
- Easy test execution with different options
- Coverage reporting capabilities
- Support for running specific test files or methods
- Verbose output options

#### `tests/README.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Test overview and organization
- How to run tests
- Test scenarios covered
- Best practices for adding new tests
- Troubleshooting guide

## Test Coverage

### Authentication Method Selection Logic

The tests verify that the right `WorkspaceClient` with the right `AuthMethod` is returned for different scenarios:

1. **Same-Workspace with OBO Scopes Available** → Uses OBO authentication
2. **Same-Workspace without Required OBO Scopes** → Falls back to U2M authentication  
3. **Cross-Workspace Operations** → Always uses U2M authentication
4. **Forced Authentication Method** → Uses the specified method regardless of context

### OBO Scope Testing

Tests cover all the different OBO scope scenarios:

1. **Basic Agent Scopes**: `vector_search`, `serving_endpoints`, `sql_warehouses`, `workspace_access`
2. **Analytics Agent Scopes**: `sql_warehouses`, `catalog_read`, `workspace_access`, `jobs`
3. **Full Agent Scopes**: All available scopes for maximum permissions
4. **Custom Scopes**: User-defined scope combinations
5. **Environment Variable Scopes**: Scopes configured via environment variables

### Operation Type Testing

Each operation type is tested with appropriate scopes:

- **vector_search** → Requires `serving.vector-search` scope
- **sql** → Requires `sql.warehouses.use` scope
- **serving_endpoint** → Requires `serving.serving-endpoints` scope
- **jobs** → Requires `jobs.view` scope
- **clusters** → Requires `clusters.use` scope
- **catalog_read** → Requires `catalog.read` scope
- **catalog_write** → Requires `catalog.write` scope

### Cross-Workspace vs Same-Workspace

Tests verify the workspace detection logic:

1. **Same Workspace**: Uses OBO when scopes are available, U2M when not
2. **Cross Workspace**: Always uses U2M regardless of OBO scope availability
3. **Workspace URL Comparison**: Proper detection of workspace boundaries

## Key Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Vector Search with OBO Scopes
```python
# Test that vector search operation uses OBO when vector_search scope is available
scope_config = OBOScopeConfig(scopes=[OBOScopes.VECTOR_SEARCH])
auth_manager = DatabricksAuthManager(..., obo_scope_config=scope_config)
client = auth_manager.get_client(operation_type="vector_search")
# Verifies OBO authentication is used
```

### Scenario 2: Cross-Workspace Operations
```python
# Test that cross-workspace operations always use U2M
auth_manager = DatabricksAuthManager(
    workspace_url="https://source.workspace.com",
    current_workspace_url="https://source.workspace.com"
)
client = auth_manager.get_client(target_workspace="https://target.workspace.com")
# Verifies U2M authentication is used regardless of OBO scopes
```

### Scenario 3: Missing OBO Scopes Fallback
```python
# Test fallback to U2M when required OBO scope is missing
scope_config = OBOScopeConfig(scopes=[OBOScopes.SQL_WAREHOUSES])  # Missing vector_search
client = auth_manager.get_client(operation_type="vector_search")
# Verifies U2M authentication is used due to missing scope
```

### Scenario 4: Agent Type Configuration
```python
# Test that different agent types get appropriate scope configurations
client = DatabricksClientFactory.create_client(
    agent_type="analytics",  # Gets analytics agent scopes
    ...
)
# Verifies analytics agent scopes are configured
```

## Test Results

All 62 tests pass successfully, providing comprehensive coverage of:

- ✅ **42 unit tests** covering core functionality
- ✅ **20 scenario tests** covering advanced use cases
- ✅ **100% test pass rate** with no failures
- ✅ **Fast execution** (completes in < 1 second)
- ✅ **No external dependencies** (fully mocked)

## How to Run

```bash
# Run all tests
cd helper
python run_tests.py -v

# Run specific test categories
python run_tests.py tests/test_auth.py -v
python run_tests.py tests/test_auth_scenarios.py -v

# Run with coverage
python run_tests.py -c
```

## What This Achieves

The test suite ensures that:

1. **Right AuthMethod is Selected**: Tests verify that OBO vs U2M selection works correctly for all scenarios
2. **Right WorkspaceClient is Created**: Tests verify that properly authenticated clients are created
3. **OBO Scopes are Validated**: Tests verify that operations are checked against available scopes
4. **Cross-Workspace Detection Works**: Tests verify that workspace boundaries are properly detected
5. **Fallback Logic Works**: Tests verify that the system gracefully falls back when needed
6. **Error Handling is Robust**: Tests verify that errors are handled appropriately

This comprehensive test suite provides confidence that the authentication system will work correctly in all the scenarios you mentioned, including different OBO scopes, same-workspace vs cross-workspace operations, and various authentication method selections.
